"""
Tiny static dev server for the Game & Media Hub.

Identical to `python -m http.server` EXCEPT it sends no-store cache headers.
Browsers aggressively cache ES modules, which repeatedly caused the browser to
run a stale copy of js/app.js (mirrors still pointed at the old test URLs).
This server makes every reload pick up the file on disk.

    py serve.py            # http://localhost:8000
    py serve.py 8080       # custom port
